The Jeep Cherokee (XJ) is a compact sport utility vehicle manufactured and
marketed across a single generation by Jeep in the United States from 1983 to
2001 — and globally through 2014. Available in three- or five-door, five
passenger, front engine, rear- or four-wheel drive configurations, the XJ was
manufactured in Toledo, Ohio, USA; Beijing, China; Ferreyra, Argentina; Cairo,
Egypt; and in Valencia, Venezuela, with production reaching approximately 3
million between 1984 and 2001.

Sharing the name of the original full-size Cherokee SJ model, the 1984 XJ
Cherokee was Jeep's first all-new vehicle design since the 1963 SJ Wagoneer, was
the first American off-roader built with fully integrated body-and-frame
(unibody) design, and became the mechanical basis for the MJ-series Jeep
Comanche pickup truck (1985–1992).
