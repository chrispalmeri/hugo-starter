The Pontiac Firebird is an American automobile built by Pontiac from the 1967 to
the 2002 model years. Designed as a pony car to compete with the Ford Mustang,
it was introduced February 23, 1967, the same model year as GM's Chevrolet
division platform-sharing Camaro. This also coincided with the release of the
1967 Mercury Cougar, Ford's upscale, platform-sharing version of the Mustang.

The name "Firebird" was also previously used by GM for the General Motors
Firebird 1950s and early 1960s concept cars.
